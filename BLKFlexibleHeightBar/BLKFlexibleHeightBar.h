/**
 The `BLKFlexibleHeightBar` class is responsible for adjusting the layout attributes (i.e. frame, transform, alpha) of its subviews depending on its current height.
 
 The height of the bar is not set directy by adjusting the bar's frame. Rather, height adjustments are made by setting the `progress` property of the bar. The progress property represents how much the bar has shrunk, with 0% progress being the bar's full height and 100% progress being the bar's minimum height.
 
 `BLKFlexibleHeightBar` is designed to support any shrinking / growing behavior. For example, Safari's shrinking header and Facebook's shrinking header behave differently. Bar behaviors can be mix and matched (and hot swapped) by setting the bar's `behaviorDefiner` property.
